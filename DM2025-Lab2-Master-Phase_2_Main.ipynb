This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n",

        "    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n",
        "    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n",
        "    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n",
        "    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n",
        "    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n",

        "By default, an LLM responds with unstructured, free-form text. For data mining, this is often impractical, as we need data in a predictable format to load into tools like a pandas DataFrame for analysis. **Structured output** is a powerful feature that forces the model to return its response in a specific, machine-readable format, such as JSON.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key to enabling this is to provide the model with a **response schema**. This schema acts as a strict template or blueprint that the model's output must conform to.

              " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

        "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",

        "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

This involves training AI models on diverse datasets and regularly checking their performance for any biases. Privacy Protecting user data should be a top priority. Strong privacy measures must be implemented, and companies should have transparent policies about how they use data. Accountability Clear guidelines need to be established regarding who is responsible for decisions made by AGI systems. This includes having legal frameworks that define who should be held accountable if any mistakes or harm occur because of AI actions. By considering these factors, we can make sure that AGI benefits society while also minimizing potential risks. It’s important to have collaboration between researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders in order to create a future where AGI is\n",

Fear can cause premature selling during market dips, while greed may have investors holding onto stocks for too long, missing the best selling points.Regret over past decisions can cloud judgment, leading investors to hold onto losing positions, and overconfidence can cause them to ignore negative market indicators. To avoid these emotional pitfalls, investors should develop a clear strategy, use stop-loss or limit orders, and maintain a long-term perspective, ensuring decisions are driven by logic rather than emotion.\n",

It depends heavily on an individual investor's specific circumstances, including their risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.\n\nHere are key factors to consider when making these decisions:\n\n**Factors Influencing Sell/Hold Decisions:**\n\n*   **Time Horizon:**\n    *   **Long-term investors:** If you have a long time horizon, you can generally afford to ride out market fluctuations and downturns.\n    *   **Short-term investors:** If you anticipate needing the money in the near future (less than one to two years), a different strategy is required, potentially involving more frequent selling.\n\n*   **Risk Tolerance:** Your comfort level with potential losses will influence how long you're willing to hold a stock, especially during volatile periods.\n\n*   **Investment Strategy:**\n    *   **Buy and Hold:** This strategy involves purchasing stocks with the intention of holding them for an extended period, regardless of short-term market movements.\n\n**Reasons an Investor Might Sell a Stock:**\n\n*   **Need to Adjust Your Portfolio:** Rebalancing your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation or to reduce overall risk.\n*   **Freeing Up Capital:** Selling a stock to access funds for other investments, emergencies, or significant purchases.\n*   **Stock Hits the Price Target:** If you set a specific price target for a stock and it reaches that level, you might decide to sell to lock in profits.\n*   **Changes in Fundamentals:** A significant deterioration in the company's financial health, competitive position, or management quality can be a reason to sell.\n*   **Opportunity Cost:** If another investment opportunity arises that offers a significantly better potential return with comparable or lower risk, you might sell a current holding to invest in the new opportunity.\n*   **Change in Ownership or Merger:** Corporate actions like mergers, acquisitions, or significant changes in ownership can alter the investment thesis and prompt a sale.\n*   **Technical Signals:** Some investors use technical analysis to identify sell signals, such as a stock breaking below key support levels.\n*   **A Market Selloff:** While not always advisable, some investors may sell during broad market downturns to limit potential losses.\n*   **Tax Treatment:** Selling a stock might be influenced by tax considerations, such as realizing capital gains or losses to offset other tax liabilities.\n\n**The Role of Emotions:**\n\nEmotions like fear, greed, regret, and overconfidence can significantly impair decision-making.\n*   **Fear** can lead to selling too early during market dips.\n*   **Greed** might cause investors to hold onto stocks too long, missing optimal selling points.\n*   **Regret** can lead to holding onto losing positions.\n*   **Overconfidence** can cause investors to ignore negative signals.\n\nTo mitigate emotional influence, it's crucial to develop a clear strategy, utilize tools like stop-loss or limit orders, and maintain a long-term perspective. Decisions should be driven by logic and your investment plan, not by fleeting emotions.\n\n**Important Note:** If you are unsure about developing an investment strategy, consider educating yourself further or consulting with a financial professional."

        "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
